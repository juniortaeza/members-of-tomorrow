                <p  class="title1">What is it?</p>
                <p class="font1"> Land pollution is the result of depositing solid and liquid materials directly onto land or underground, thus contaminating soil and groundwater.</p>
                <p class="font1"> In the 1900s, we created the idea of “landfills” and deposited waste and garbage directly into lands. This would be the signifier for the continuation of depositing into landfills. The waste and garbage we deposit into the ground compose of hundreds of millions of tons of toxic chemicals and plastic materials that will take thousands of years to degrade naturally.</p>
                <p class="font1"> Nearly a century later, although we have more sustainable methods of disposing materials, we still deposit materials into landfills.</p>

                <p  class="title1"> What exactly causes it?</p>
                <p class="font1">There are several factors that contribute to land pollution both directly and indirectly. A significant factor to it however is the use of landfills. When waste material is deposited into the ground, it contaminates the soil and groundwater beneath the waste. Landfills develop gas overtime due to the natural decomposition of waste and this gas is a significant contributor to climate change. Annually, hundreds of millions of tons of waste are deposited into landfills. Other factors that contribute to it are:</p>
                    <p class="font1"> • Deforestation, destroying natural habitats and building facilities over them, significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions</p>
                    <p class="font1"> • Use of chemicals in agricultural activities, thus contaminating soil and groundwater</p>
                    <p class="font1"> • Littering, widespread soil and water contamination spread by us humans because of improper disposal of trash</p>

            <p class="font1"> Here is a 2017 NPRI based chart of pollutants released into the environment and map of all of the sites where waste is deposited into the land in Canada alone:</p>
             
            <p class="font1"> Canada’s NPRI stands for Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory and keeps track of pollutants released into the environment in Canada alone.</p>
                <p class="font1"> • In this chart, the NPRI declares that 1.7 million tons of waste and substances were deposited into landfills as reported by only 7,000 facilities in Canada</p>
                <p class="font1"> • A similar chart conducted by the NPRI compared 2017’s information to 2008’s information and declared that the release of waste into the ground increased by 109%</p>
                <p class="font1"> These sites all contribute to the terrifying amount of 1.8 million tons of waste injected into the ground in just 2017 alone.</p>

            <p class="title1"> What are the effects of land pollution?</p>
            <p class="font1"> The effects of land pollution are detrimental to the sustainability of our planet.</p>
                <p  class="title2"> With the support of the Canada government’s NPRI reports, land pollution has affected our planet in the following ways:</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Landfill gas accumulated from landfills releases methane, a gas deadlier than carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Billions of tons of carbon dioxide get released into the atmosphere because of trash and contributes to the increase of our global temperature</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Helps contribute to air pollution, an already present complication that we are struggling to deal with</p>
