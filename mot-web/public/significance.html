                <p class="title1"> Significance</p>
                <p class="font1"> When we talk about sustaining our Earth, basically we talk about a sustainable environment. Protecting Earth means protecting its nature and the creatures living on it. Everything in the ecosystem is interconnected with each other in many ways. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="insider1ksig"><img style=" border-radius: 20px"  src="pictures/significance1.png"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="mid1sig" style="height: 400px; margin-top: 150px;">
            <p  class="title2"> Why do we need a sustainable environment? </p>
            <p class="font1"> We need to realize the necessity of sustainability before we jump on the topic. Here “sustainable” doesn’t mean that we will be living somehow by accepting the current disasters causing by climate change day after day. Environmental sustainability is responsibly interacting with the planet to maintain natural resources and not jeopardize the ability for future generations to meet their needs.</p>
            <p class="font1">  This concern is also about our own health and preservation of rare species of animals. A healthy environment provides nutrients that flow up the food chain, from plants to animals, to provide energy. By preserving nature, the planet and all its inhabitants are guaranteed a constant supply of clean water and fresh air. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mid1">
            <div class="insider2k" style="width: 640px;">
                <p class="title2"> What are the costs of making a sustainable environment?</p>
                <p class="font1"> To make a sustainable environment, we don’t have to waste much from our valuable possessions. Rather, it can help us saving our money. In modern era, we want to grow economically and as a result we end up building unplanned industrial factories. They produce chemical products such as heavy metal, non-biodegradable wastes and other elements which are really hazardous for our environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insider1ksig" style="width: 800px; height: 800px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 100px;"><img style=" border-radius: 20px"  src="pictures/significance2.png"></div>

        </div>

        <div class="mid1sig">
            <div class="insider2ksig" style="width: 850px;">
                <p class="font1">  Again, when these chemical products mix up with the water of any river or sea, it contaminates the water as well as destroys the balance between BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) which endangers the lives of sea creatures. If we could just follow the policy of green chemistry, it would never have happened. There are lots of benefits of green chemistry that can help us economically and saving the environment simultaneously.</p>
                <p class="font1"> Furthermore, recycling is one of the best policies which can be used by all sorts of people. It can save our money and help us from wasting unnecessary energy. </p>

                <p class="font1"> So, all we need to do is to follow some nature friendly policies to save our environment and grow awareness among people. </p>

        <div class="mid1sig" style="margin-top: 250px; height: 490px;">
            <p class="title2">What if we don’t make our environment sustainable?</p>
            <p class="font1">Earth’s climate has been changing since she started healing herself after the Big Bang explosion. But the rate of this change is increasing day by day. It will be hard for humans and other creatures to adapt to such changes. Animals who couldn’t keep up with the changes have already faced extinction and some of them are on the brink of extinction. Climate change is one of the consequences of an unsustainable environment. </p>
            <p class="font1">Our climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. Ice is melting in Antarctica, the temperature is rising, natural disasters are occurring frequently, hurricanes are becoming more intense, sea level is rising and all of these are happening only because of climate change.</p>

            <div class="insider2k" style="width: 700px;">
                <p class="font1">We can portray a recent incident of Australian bushfire as evidence of what will happen if we don’t build a sustainable environment. 
                <p class="font1">local impacts of the Australian Bushfires had devastated properties and life in the country while producing extreme air quality impacts throughout the region. Animals such as koala, kangaroo; were killed and injured severely by the bushfire. The consequences of not making Earth and her environment sustainable are far beyond dreadful as we can observe from recent incidents around the globe.</p>
