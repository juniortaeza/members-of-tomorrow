                <p class="title1"> What is it?</p>
                <p class="font1"> Marine pollution is the result of waste and chemicals being directly released into the ocean or finds its way into the ocean. The waste component consists of plastic and materials that have elements that decompose in thousands of years. The chemical component consists of oil spills, sewage, and any outlets that release contaminants into our oceans, rivers, and lakes.</p>
                <p class="font1"> In the mid-1900s, it was observed that humans did not care much for the release of pollutants into our waters. Production of plastics and single-use products multiplied in this time and thus so did pollution into our oceans. Earth is made up of roughly 75% water and the pollutants we dump into the ocean, will end up in our bodies eventually: it is a cycle.</p>
                <p class="font1"> Even to this day, we are still dumping oil and sewage materials into the ocean, and we are still producing plastic which eventually finds its way into our oceans.</p>

            <div class= "insider2k">
                <p class="title1"> What exactly causes it?</p>
                <p class="font1"> Anything non-organic that finds its way to the ocean is considered a marine pollutant. It is considered a marine pollutant because it destroys habitats, millions of species both discovered and undiscovered, and entire ecosystems. This can be plastic, the trash in your trash bin, radioactive waste dumped into oceans by various governments, the candy wrapper you did not throw away properly: it can be anything. These always find their way into the ocean if they are not disposed of properly and they are very toxic to marine ecosystems and to our own bodies.

            <p class="font1"> The RED indicates the release of pollutants directly into the water and you can see that from 2008-2017, there has been no significant decline in reducing marine pollution.</p>
            <p class="font1"> • This chart expresses the lack of responsibility by thousands of facilities and a clear indicator that not enough effort is being put into combatting marine pollution. </p>

                <p class="title1"> What are the effects of marine pollution?</p>
            <p class="font1">The effects of marine pollution are detrimental to the sustainability of our planet.</p>
            <p class="font1"> With the support of NASA and Canada’s NPRI data, marine pollution has affected our planet in the following ways:</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Plastics (material that takes thousands of years to decompose) break down into microplastics and scatter everywhere in our oceans, destroying ecosystems and polluting the water</p>
                <p class="font1"> • With global warming already in play with air and land pollution, materials cannot easily be broken down in warm waters; already adding onto the hundreds of millions of tons of plastics and pollutants being dumped in the ocean</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Marine ecosystems are being destroyed and the very water we consume are contaminating our bodies</p>

        <div class="mid1">
            <p class="font1"> With data collected from Canada’s NPRI, we were able to see what kind of substance they were releasing into our oceans. Here are the effects of those substances on the human body:</p>
            <p class="font1"> • Increases chances for brain and heart diseases</p>
            <p class="font1"> • Increases chances for failure in our reproductive organs</p>
            <p class="font1"> • Affects major organs in our body</p>
            <p class="font1"> • Increases hormonal problems</p>
