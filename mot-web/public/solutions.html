                <p class="title2"> Air Pollution</p> 
                <p class="font1"> How can we fight it and help sustain our planet?</p>
                <p class="font1"> A way we can fight air pollution is through the use of technology and global efforts of humanity. NASA’s Earth-observing satellites for example allows us to track air quality from all around the world. This data is then transmitted back to Earth and is incorporated in pollution-tracking products such as the U.S. Air Quality Index and gives us an idea of our current state of health and what we can do to sustain.</p>
                <p class="font1"> However, we must not rely heavily on NASA and technology alone.</p>

        <div class="mid1short">
            <p class="font1"> We as humans must also take action to help combat air pollution and here are steps you can take:</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Practice the use of non-chemical-based transportation (bicycles, walking, etc.)</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Try converting to electricity as a source of energy rather than fossil fuels</p>
                <p class="font1"> • Use organic consumer products and not single-use materials </p>
                <p class="font1"> • Spread the word!</p>

                <p class="title2"> Land Pollution</p>
                <p class="font1"> How can we fight it and help sustain our planet?</p>
                <p class="font1"> We can fight land pollution through the use of technology and the combination of community efforts. Technology such as that of Globe Portal System JAXA’s satellite product “LST” which is short for Land Surface Temperature, can read the temperature on land and see direct regions and areas that have the high temperatures. This way, you can see the direct impact landfills have on land. Another way we can combat land pollution is through the use of ethical annual reports of facilities that are releasing pollutants into the environment. With this information, you can have estimates of the impact we are doing to the environment. </p>
                <p class="font1"> Similarly, we must not rely heavily on technology and reports. </p>

            <p class="font1"> We as humans have to make a global effort of reducing the release of pollutants into our lands and here are steps you can take: </p>
                <p class="font1"> • Recycle! Recycling products prevents the manufacturing of single-use plastics and products </p>
                <p class="font1"> • Consider using organic products. This will significantly reduce the release of methane into the air through landfills </p>
                <p class="font1"> • Dispose trash properly! Littering is a huge problem we have and they can end up scattered on our lands and in our oceans </p>
                <p class="font1"> • Educate your friends and family! </p>

                <p class="font1">How can we fight it and help sustain our planet?</p>
                <p class="font1"> We can fight marine pollution through the use of integrating technology into our daily lives and acting on the data and reports we receive and working together as a community. Canada’s Government has concise methods of distributing water stations around their country to monitor the amount of pollutants being released into the ocean, wastewater treatment plants that obliterates sewage, and industrial facilities that exterminate hard solids that end up in our oceans. </p>
                <p class="font1"> We cannot be too reliant on just technology and data alone. </p>

            <p class="font1"> We as humans must work together and fight marine pollution together and reduce pollutants entering our waters. Here are ways you can help: </p>

                <p class="font1"> • Recycle materials properly </p>
