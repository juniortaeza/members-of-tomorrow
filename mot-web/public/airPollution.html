                <p class="title1"> What is it?</p>
                <p class="font1">Air pollution is the result of aerosols suspended in the air. Aerosols make up of solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are released from factories, cars, trucks, wildfires, and many more.</p> 
                <p class="font1">In the 1800s, an age of the creation of large factories and chemical-based products such as cars and trucks emerged in a period we like to call “The Industrial Revolution.” This period accelerated the bad practice of burning fossil fuels and releasing pollutants such as mold, soot, and chemicals into our skies and influenced hundreds of countries world-wide to do the same.</p> 
                <p class="font1">Fast forward a couple hundred years to 2020, and you will be surprised to learn that we still perform the same practice of releasing contaminants into the sky. </p>

                <p class="title1"> What exactly causes it?</p>
                <p class="font1">So, now we know what air pollution is and what aerosols are, but where exactly do they come from? In many factories and large manufacturing facilities around the world, they commonly practice what we call “burning of fossil fuels.” Fossil fuels to be exact consist of oil, coal, and natural gases. We burn these because there is an abundance of these resources from around the world and they are very convenient to acquire! However, when fossil fuels are burned, they release nitrogen dioxide into the atmosphere. This is a chemical that is awfully bad for your health and lungs! Also, this chemical is suspended in the air and traps heat from the sun into our atmosphere, thus contributing to climate change and global warming!</p>

                <p class="font1">The RED indicates levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), a toxic substance that is unhealthy to breathe, commonly released by factories and cities that burn fossil fuels and use chemical-based transportation such as cars and trucks.</p> 
                <p class="font1">Notice how the RED regions on the map gradually increased in East of North America and maintained in Central and South-East Asia in just a span of ten years. </p> 
                <p class="font1">Using NASA’s NRT Earthdata of Earth’s Air Quality 2020, it is declared that Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, all countries of South Asia, rank in the bottom of annual rankings for air quality.</p>  
                <p class="font1">This was just one example of how large quantities of emission through the burning of fossil fuels declines the air quality in certain regions of the world.</p>

                <p class="title1"> What are the effects of air pollution?</p>
                <p class="font1">The effects of air pollution are detrimental to the sustainability of our planet. </p> 
                <p class="title2">As of 2020, with the support of NASA’s data, air pollution has affected our planet in the following ways:</p> 
                    <p class="font1">• Carbon dioxide levels have been at an all time high in 650,000 years</p> 
                    <p class="font1">• Global temperature has increased 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880</p> 
                    <p class="font1">• Arctic Ice quantity has been decreasing at a rate of 12.85% per decade</p>

            <p class="title2">The World Health Organization in collaboration with NASA has declared that air pollution has the following effects on the human body:</p> 
                <p class="font1">• Increases respiratory illnesses including pulmonary disease, respiratory infections, and lung cancer</p> 
                <p class="font1">• Increases chances of heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes</p> 
                <p class="font1">• These diseases are consistent with each individual</p>
